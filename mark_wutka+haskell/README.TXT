I found that in doing these problems in Python, I developed a number of
reusable routines. In starting over in Haskell, I created a Roselib module
where I am putting routines that I believe will be used in multiple
problems.

There are a number of utility classes in the Roselib directory and they are
installable with Cabal. Just go to Roselib and do:
cabal build
cabal install

My Haskell code seems to end up looking like lisp, with what I perceive
as too many parens. I would welcome suggestions on how to make it look
better and ways to improve the code.
