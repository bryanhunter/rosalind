I found that in doing these problems in Python, I developed a number of
reusable routines. In starting over in Haskell, I created a Roselib module
where I am putting routines that I believe will be used in multiple
problems.

When compiling a solution, add -i.. to the ghc command to allow it to find
the Roselib module.
